Abstract

Depictive expressions of thought predate written language by thousands of years. They have
evolved in communities through a kind of informal user testing that has refined them. Analyzing
common visual communications reveals consistencies that illuminate how people think as well as
guide design; the process can be brought into the laboratory and accelerated. Like language, visual
communications abstract and schematize; unlike language, they use properties of the page (e.g., prox-
imity and place: center, horizontal⁄up–down, vertical⁄left–right) and the marks on it (e.g., dots, lines,
arrows, boxes, blobs, likenesses, symbols) to convey meanings. The visual expressions of these
meanings (e.g., individual, category, order, relation, correspondence, continuum, hierarchy) have
analogs in language, gesture, and especially in the patterns that are created when people design the
world around them, arranging things into piles and rows and hierarchies and arrays, spatial-abstrac-
tion-action interconnections termedspractions. The designed world is a diagram.

1. Introduction

Communication in the wild is a sound and light show combining words, prosody, facial
expressions, gestures, and actions. Although it is often presumed—think of the ‘‘letter of
the law’’ and transcripts of trials—that meanings are neatly packaged into words joined by
rules into utterances, in fact, other channels of communication carry significant aspects of
meaning, despite or perhaps because of the fact that they cannot be neatly packaged into
units strung together by rules (e.g., Clark, 1996; Goldin-Meadow, 2003; Kendon, 2004;
McNeill, 1992, 2005). Prosody, as in irony or sarcasm, can overrule and even reverse
meanings of words, as can facial expressions. Pointing can replace words, for things, for

directions, and more, so that natural descriptions, narratives, or explanations cannot be fully
understood from the words alone (e.g., Emmorey, Tversky, & Taylor, 2000). Gestures go
beyond pointing; they can show size, shape, pattern, manner, position, direction, order,
quantity, both literally and metaphorically. They can express abstract meanings, mood,
affect, evaluation, attitude, and more. Gestures and actions convey this rich set of meanings
by using position, form, and movement in space. Communication can happen wordlessly, as
in avoiding collisions on busy sidewalks or placing items on the counter next to the cash
register to indicate an intention to buy. In fact, the shelf next to the cash register is designed
to play a communicative role. Standing next to a circle of chatting acquaintances can be a
request to join the conversation. Opening the circle is the group’s wordless response.
Rolling one’s eyes can signify, well, rolling one’s eyes. Communication in the wild com-
bines and integrates these modes, usually seamlessly, with each contributing to the overall
meaning (e.g., Clark, 1996; Engle, 1998; Goldin-Meadow, 2004; Kendon, 2004; McNeill,
1996; Tomasello, 2008).
Gestures and actions are especially convenient because their tools, like the tools for
speech, are free, and they are always with us. But gestures, like speech, are fleeting; they
quickly disappear. They are limited by what can be produced and comprehended in real
time. These limitations render gestures abstract and schematic. Visualizations, on paper,
silk, parchment, wood, stone, or screen, are more permanent; they can be inspected and rein-
spected. Because they persist, they can be subjected to myriad perceptual processes: Com-
pare, contrast, assess similarity, distance, direction, shape, and size, reverse figure and
ground, rotate, group and regroup; that is, they can be mentally assessed and rearranged in
multiple ways that contribute to understanding, inference, and insight. Visualizations can be
viewed as the permanent traces of gestures; both embody and are embodied. Like gesture,
visualizations use position, form, and actions in space to convey meanings (e.g., Tversky,
Heiser, Lee, & Daniel, 2009). For visualizations, fleeting positions become places and fleet-
ing actions become marks and forms. Here, we analyze the ways that place and form con-
strain and convey meaning, meanings that are based in part in actions.
Traces of visual communication go far back into prehistory. Indeed, they are one of the
earliest signs of culture. They not only precede written language but also served as the basis
for it (e.g., Gelb, 1963; Schmandt-Besserat, 1996). Visual communications come in myriad
forms: animals in cave paintings, maps in petroglyphs, tallies on bones, histories on col-
umns, battles in tapestries, messages on birch bark, journeys in scrolls, stories in stained
glass windows, dramas in comics, diagrams in manuals, charts in magazines, and graphs in
journals. All forms of communication entail design, as the intent of communication is to be
understood by others or by one’s self at another time. Communication design, then, is inher-
ently social, because to be understood by another or by self at another time entails fashion-
ing communications to fit the presumed mental states of others or of one’s self at another
time.
Diagrams, along with pictures, film, paintings in caves, notches in wood, incisions in
stone, cuttings in bone, impressions in clay, illustrations in books, paintings on walls, and
of course words and gestures, externalize thought. They do this for many reasons, often
several simultaneously. Some are aesthetic: to arouse emotions or evoke pleasure. Some are

500 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


behavioral: to affect action or promote collaboration. Some are cognitive: to serve as
reminders, to focus thoughts, to reorganize thoughts, and to explore thoughts. Many are
communicative: to inform both self and others.
Because depictions, like other cultural artifacts (e.g., Norman, 1993; Donald, 1991), have
evolved over time, they have undergone an informal but powerful kind of natural user test-
ing, produced by some, comprehended by others, and refined and revised to improve com-
munication by a community of users. Similar processes have served and continue to serve to
design and redesign language (cf. Clark, 1996). Features and forms that have been invented
and reinvented across cultures and time are likely to be effective. Analyzing these depictive
communications, then, can provide valuable clues to designing new ones. It can save and
inspire laboratory work, as well as the tasks of designers. What is more, the natural evolu-
tion of communication design can be brought into the laboratory and accelerated for specific
ends (see Tversky et al., 2007).
Oddly, this rich set of visual forms has traditionally been discussed in the domain of art,
along with painting, drawing, and photography. Increasingly, that discussion has expanded
to include diagrams, charts, film, graphs, notational systems, visual instructions, computer
interfaces, comics, movies, and more, to take into account the mind that perceives, con-
ceives, and understands them, and to ripple across domains (e.g., Arnheim, 1974; Bertin,
1981; Card, Mackinlay, & Shneiderman, 1999; Elkin, 1999; Gombrich, 1961; Goodman,
1978; Kulvicki, 2006; McCloud, 1994; Murch, 2001; Small, 1997; Stafford, 2007; Wainer,
1992; Ware, 2008; Winn, 1987; Tufte, 1983, 1990, 1997). Similarly, discussions of human
communication have historically focused on language, typically narrowly conceived as
words and sentences, and have only recently broadened to include prosody, gesture, and
action (e.g., Argyle, 1988; Clark, 1996; Goldin-Meadow, 2003; Kendon, 2004; McNeill,
1996).
Unlike symbolic words, forms of visual communication, notably diagrams and gestures,
often work by a kind of resemblance, that is, sharing features or associations, typically
visuo-spatial features, with the meanings they are intended to convey (a claim of some
philosophic controversy, e.g., Goodman, 1978; Hochberg & Brooks, 1962; Walton, 1990).
The proverbial ‘‘big fish’’ is indicated in gesture by expanding the fingers or hands horizon-
tally, thus capturing the approximate relative horizontal extent of the fish, but ignoring its
other properties. How the fish swam to try to get away is abstracted and conveyed differ-
ently, perhaps by embodying the fish and its movements. Similarly, the shape, dimensions,
and even actions of the fish can be abstracted in a variety of ways to the page. The fish
example illustrates another property of visual communication. In capturing features of the
world, visual communications are highly selective; they omit information, normally infor-
mation that is regarded as less essential for the purposes at hand. They abstract and schema-
tize not only by omission but also by exaggeration and even by additions. Maps, for
example, are not simply shrunken aerial photographs. Maps selectively omit most informa-
tion, houses, trees, fields, mountains, and the like, but also many of the twists and turns of
roads or coastlines; they disproportionately enlarge roads and rivers to make them visible;
they turn entire metropolises into dots. Maps may also add features like government bound-
aries and topological levels that are not visible.

In other words, maps, like many other kinds of visualizations, distort the ‘‘truth’’ to tell a
larger truth. The processes that abstract, schematize, supplement, and distort the world out-
side onto the world of a page, filtering, leveling, sharpening, categorizing, and otherwise
transforming, are the same processes the nervous system and the brain apply to make sense
of the barrage of stimuli the world provides. Attention is selective, ignoring much incoming
information. The perceptual systems level and sharpen the information that does come in;
for example, the visual system searches for the boundaries that define figures by sharpening
edges and corners, by filling in gaps, by normalizing shapes. Cognition filters, abstracts, and
categorizes, continuing this process, and symbol systems carry these processes further. Long
things do not necessarily get long names, though children often expect them to (e.g.,
Tolchinsky Landsmann & Levin, 1987). Tallies eliminate the identity of objects, recording
them just as instances, though tallies preserve a one-to-one correspondence that Arabic
numerals, more convenient for calculations, do not.
The virtues of visual communications have been extolled by many (e.g., Kirsh, 1995;
Larkin & Simon, 1987; Norman, 1993; Scaife & Rogers, 1996; Tversky, 1995; Tversky,
2001). As noted, they are cultural artifacts created in a community (Donald, 1991; Norman,
1993), fine-tuned by their users (e.g., Tversky et al., 2007). They can provide a permanent,
public record that can be pointed at or referred to. They externalize and clarify common
ground. They can be understood, revised, and manipulated by a community. They relieve
limited capacity short-term memory, they facilitate information processing, they expand
long-term memory, they organize thought, they promote inference and discovery. Because
they are visual and spatial, they allow human agility in visual-spatial processing and infer-
ence to be applied to visual-spatial information and to metaphorically spatially abstract
information.
In contrast to purely symbolic words, visual communications can convey some content
and structure directly. They do this in part by using elements, marks on a page, virtual or
actual, and spatial relations, proximity and place on a page, to convey literal and metaphoric
elements and relations. These ways of communicating meanings may not provide definitions
with the rigor of words, but rather provide suggestions for meanings and constraints on
them, giving them greater flexibility than words. That flexibility means that many of the
meanings thus conveyed need context and experience to fully grasp. A line in a route map
has a different meaning from a line in a network and from a line in a graph, though, signifi-
cantly, all connect. Nor is the expressive power of visual communication as great as that of
language (e.g., Stenning & Oberlander, 1995); abstract or invisible concepts like forces,
traits, counterfactuals, and negations are not easily conveyed unambiguously in depictions.
Even so, conventions for conveying these kinds of concepts have evolved as needed, in road
signs, mathematics, science, architecture, engineering, and other domains, a gradual process
of symbolization akin to language.
What are the tools of depictions, especially diagrams? How do they communicate? The
components of visual communication are simple: Typically, a flat surface, prototypically, a
page (or something analogous to a page like a computer screen) and marks or forms placed
on it (e.g., Ittelson, 1996; Tversky, 1995, 2001; Tversky, Zacks, Lee, & Heiser, 2000). Each
of these, place and form, will be analyzed to show how they can represent meanings that are

502 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


literal and metaphoric, concrete and abstract. The interpretations will be shown to depend
on content and context, on Gestalt or mathematical properties of the marks in space, on the
place of the marks on the page, as well as the information processing capacities and procliv-
ities of the mind. The foundations and processes of assigning meaning can be revealed, then,
by recurring inventions and by errors and biases in interpretation, that is, by uses and mis-
uses, by successes and failures. The analysis of inventions of visual communication can pro-
vide directions for the design of visual communications.
Because assigning meaning, whether from description or depiction, is in part a reductive
process—the space of possible meanings is greater than the space of ways to express mean-
ings—misuses, misinterpretations, and misunderstandings are as inevitable as successes,
and both are instructive. Expressing meanings, then, entails categorization. Categories cre-
ate boundaries where none exist; some instances are included and others, even close ones,
are not. The consequence of categorization is to increase the perceived similarity of mem-
bers included in the category and to exaggerate the perceived distance between members
and nonmembers. Although the focus here is on meanings conveyed through place and
forms, the meanings are deeper, they are conceptually spatial, some more literal, some more
metaphorical, so that they have parallels in other ways of using space as well, in words, in
actions, and in gesture, in the virtual space created by gesture and the mental space created
by words (e.g., Gattis, 2004; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Tversky et al., 2009). First, we will
discuss place in space, and then forms in space.

2. Place in space

2.1. Organizing space in the world

2.1.1. Spatial actions create meaningful patterns
Three quarters of a million years ago, a group of hominins living in the northern
Jordan River valley separated the activities of communal life into different spatial areas,
cooking activities in one area and tool-building activities in another (Alperson-Afil
et al., 2009). Each of these spaces was subdivided, again by function. This primate
society created unintended visual communications about their lives to archeologists liv-
ing generations afterwards. Before the page, there was space itself. Perhaps the simplest
way to use space to communicate is to arrange or rearrange things in it. An early pro-
cess is grouping things in space using proximity, putting similar things in close proxim-
ity and farther from dissimilar things, actions that reflect the Gestalt laws of perception.
These separated spatial groupings signal separate associated things. ‘‘Close’’ family
members and friends sit nearer to one another than strangers. The flatware tray in a
drawer of most kitchens allows arranging the knives together in one pile and separating
them from the pile of forks and the pile of spoons. Drawers in the bedroom allow
arranging the socks together and separating them from other articles of clothing that
are also grouped and piled by kind. Shelves and drawers allow hierarchical organiza-
tion, one shelf for canned goods, another for baking supplies, further organized inside

by kind and recency of purchase, in two dimensions. Table settings distribute various
items in one-to-one correspondences, each setting gets a plate, a glass, a knife, a fork,
a spoon, and a napkin. Themes as well as categories are spatially organized, things for
cooking spatially separated from things for sleeping. Larger spaces, homes, and villages
are arranged in two and three dimensions, turning inhabited spaces into diagrams, verti-
cal patterns of windows on buildings and horizontal patterns of streets on the ground.
We rearrange things in space to capture attention and to affect behavior in the present
as well as the future, for example, putting the letters to be mailed by the door or the
bills to be paid on the top of the desk (or desktop) or lining up the ingredients for a
recipe in order of use (e.g., Kirsch, 1993), ordinal mappings of time and actions in
time onto space. Written text is spatially arranged to reflect the organization of thought,
spaces between words and sentences, larger spaces between paragraphs. Greek text
describing mathematics was written formulaically, fixed orders of semantic forms, often
in rows, that formed tables for reasoning (Netz, 1999). Even babies do it; many dis-
cover ‘‘in your face’’ early on. When they want attention, they center their faces in the
face of the person whose attention they seek, directly in the line of vision. A funda-
mental service of space, hence meaning of space, is proximity to me. I can perceive
and act on the things and beings that are close to me, in reach of the body, primarily
eyes, hands, feet, and, for beings, voice. For my actions (and my perception), the best
position is centered in front of me. These many deliberate organizations of space serve
to direct attention, to augment memory, to facilitate and organize actions, and to com-
municate to ourselves or to others.
One implication of this analysis is that action underlies perception. The actions of orga-
nizing space for many ends into groups, hierarchies, orders, correspondences, continua, and
the like create spatial patterns that are far more regular than those created by nature, thus a
signal that they are created by sentient minds. These regular spatial patterns conform to the
Gestalt laws of perception, augmenting their perceptibility. Things that entail similar
actions, whether socks or knives, are grouped together, creating stacks or piles, and things
that entail ordered actions are lined up in that order, along a line, creating a temporal contin-
uum on a horizontal surface. Perception of stacks and lines is enhanced by the Gestalt Laws
of good continuation or common fate.
Not much farther afield, architecture can be viewed as an advanced form of arranging
things in space (in three dimensions) for a number of reasons, among them, to inform and to
facilitate or constrain action. Department stores put like things close to each other, separat-
ing them from different things. The grouping is hierarchical, men’s clothes together,
women’s clothes together, and within each, shirts in one place and outerwear in another.
Architectural spaces are also designed to affect behavior. Elevators are placed in eyesight of
entrances, desired corridors are broad and well lit. Departments in department stores were
once geometrically organized along parallel and perpendicular paths, presumably because
such an organization facilitates way-finding (e.g., Tversky, 1981). Increasingly, they seem
to be organized like Chinese gardens, in zigzagging meandering paths. In Chinese gardens,
a meandering organization of space creates surprises and the impression of a larger space to
be contemplated and enjoyed. In department stores, a meandering organization undoubtedly

504 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


interferes with way-finding and provides more temptations to purchase. In architectural
designs, the plan, a horizontal slice, serves action and the elevation, a vertical slice, serves
aesthetics (e.g., Arnheim, 1977).
Spaces are also arranged and designed for symbolic and aesthetic reasons. The square
patterns that cultures as distant as China and Rome used to build their cities, with roads
aligned north-south and east-west, seem to serve several ends at once, cognitive, aesthetic,
and symbolic. Other patterns that are consequences of organizing space appear and reappear
across cultures in ceramics, weaving, basket-making, and architecture (as well as poetry and
music), especially patterns that have geometric repetitions and symmetries (e.g., Arnheim,
1988; Gombrich, 1979).
Spaces are also created on the fly, to serve behavior (the reminders on the desk) or com-
munication. Arrernte speakers in Australia routinely draw the locations and movements of
their conversation topics in the sand (Wilkins, 1997). When people describe locations of
places or events involving actions, like football plays or accidents, they often use whatever
small objects are at hand—coins, salt shakers, Lego blocks, or fingers—to represent the
locations and movements of whatever they are describing, creating a map on a surface. If
pencil and paper are handy, they often sketch instead (e.g., Kessell & Tversky, 2006).

2.1.2. Conception, action, perception, communication, and meaning
People, then, design and redesign the spaces they inhabit, arranging them and rearranging
them to serve a variety of ends. The spaces they create are a visible embodiment of the
abstract concepts underlying the organizations. These spaces form regular patterns that reso-
nate with principles of perceptual organization. The close couplings of action, conception,
and perception support meanings and afford communication. The examples above are few
from many, but they illustrate some of the core phenomena. People put like things together,
often into piles, rows, or bins, and separate them from different things. They cluster by kind,
often hierarchically. They order things in rows or piles in a variety of ways, depending on
their purpose, ingredients in order of use, photograph albums in order of time, bills to be
paid in order of importance. These acts select single features and create single dimensions
or continua out of disparate things. People also arrange things by themes, and distribute sets
of items in one-to-one correspondences. They choose distances and sizes in three dimen-
sions. Whether informally in conversation or more formally on maps and architectural plans,
people also map locations in the world onto a representing world, models, or diagrams.
These same kinds of organization in space, clusters, orders, maps, and more, are used to
locate things on a page to represent and communicate ways things are organized and related
in the mind as well as in the world.

2.2. Organizing the space of a page, more literally

As we have seen, people arrange and rearrange the things in the spaces around them into
clusters, orders, and more complex organizations for cognitive, social, aesthetic, and sym-
bolic ends. People do the same with the space of a page, for things that are literally spatial
as well as things that are metaphorically spatial. In contrast to the space of the world, the

```

space of a page is two-dimensional, though it allows conveying three and more dimensions.
Conceptually, the two dimensions of a page are defined with respect to a viewer’s frame of
reference and a page oriented horizontally, left–right and top–bottom (or up–down) (cf.
Arnheim, 1974, 1988). Conceptually, there is also a page-centric frame of reference: center,
periphery.
We begin with an early, basic organization of the space of a page or virtual page, what
can be called pictorial space, used to map and represent the visible world. Think first of
ancient paintings of animals in the rugged ceilings of caves or the tadpole figures of people
drawn by children all over the world (e.g., Kellogg, 1969). Several aspects of place on the
page will be analyzed through prevalent examples: up⁄down, left⁄right, center, and proxim-
ity among them. Some of those uses benefit thought, some benefit conflict, and some even
hinder, but all are a testament to the cognitive power of place and marks on the page.

2.2.1. Pictorial space
Perhaps the earliest and simplest and still the most common way to use space in
depictions is to map the space of the viewed world to a surface, what is traditionally called a
picture. This mapping takes the three-dimensional world into a two-dimensional one, the
page, a transformation that is undoubtedly facilitated by the fact that the world captured by
the retina and the rest of the visual system is a two-dimensional mapping of the three-dimen-
sional world from a particular perspective. Mapping pictorial space to the page puts things
on the ground at the bottom of the page and things in the sky at the top, just as at an easel
that holds the page in the plane of the world. Put horizontally on a table, the space of the
page is mapped so the ground is close to the viewer, ‘‘at the bottom,’’ and the sky is far
from the viewer, ‘‘at the top’’ (cf. Shephard & Hurwitz, 1984). This correspondence applies
the notion of ‘‘upright’’ to the page. It is such a compelling organization of space that
upside down pictures are harder to recognize and remember, and especially faces of individ-
uals, stimuli of special significance in our lives (e.g., Hochberg & Galper, 1967; Carey,
Diamond, & Woods, 1980; Rock, 1973).
When placed horizontally, as on a table or desk, the actual space of the page conflicts
with the actual surrounding space as the ground-to-sky bottom-to-top dimension of the page
is no longer literally vertical as it is in the world. Nevertheless, the mapping of vertical to
horizontal where ground is close to the viewer’s perspective is conceptually powerful, so
that the opposite mapping is regarded as upside-down. The pull of the picture plane is so
strong that students in a course in information design use it implicitly in diagramming infor-
mation systems. In diagrams of information systems, what must be shown are the topologi-
cal relations among the system components (Nickerson, Corter, Tversky, Zahner, & Rho,
2008). The actual locations of components are irrelevant; all that matters is the connections
among them, indicated by lines. Nevertheless, designers’ sketches frequently map physical
locations, for example, placing a truck that transmits information at the bottom of the page,
as if on the ground, and a satellite at the top, as if in the sky. Although organizing a sketch
using pictorial space may aid comprehension of the components of the system, it could pre-
vent designers from ‘‘seeing’’ and using other organizations of components that might make
better sense for the design.

2.2.2. Maps
Like the making of pictures, the making of maps entails shrinking a viewed environment
as well as selecting and perhaps distorting important features and omitting others (Tversky,
2000). However, the making of maps requires more, beginning with taking a perspective not
often seen in real life, a perspective from above, looking down. Maps, even ancient ones,
typically include far more than can be seen from a single viewpoint, so that the making of
maps also entails integrating many different views to convey a more comprehensive one.
Despite these challenges, evidence of maps, typically petroglyphs as they survive the rav-
ages of time, goes back at least 6,000 years (e.g., Brown, 1979) and of architectural plans
nearly that far. Although maps often represent a horizontally extended world on a horizontal
surface, they are frequently placed vertically (‘‘upright’’), requiring the same transformation
that pictorial representations do (but without gravity and a conceptual up and down). Even
though arbitrary, the conventional north-up orientation of maps has both cognitive and prac-
tical consequences; north-up maps are easier for many judgments (e.g., Sholl, 1987).
Maps are one of the most ancient, modern, and widespread means of visual communica-
tion, and they serve as an illustrative paradigm for many aspects of visual communication.
Ancient as they are, maps represent remarkable feats of the human mind, the products of
powerful mental transformations. Although human experience is primarily from within
environments, a perspective that has been called egocentric, route, or embedded, maps take
a viewpoint from outside environments, above them, a perspective that has been called
extrinsic, allocentric, or survey. Thus, the making of maps and the understanding of maps
entail a dramatic switch of perspective, one that takes remarkably little effort for well-
learned environments (e.g., Taylor & Tversky, 1992b; Lee & Tversky, 2005). What is more,
just as spontaneous descriptions of space mix perspectives, using route and survey expres-
sions in the same clause (Taylor & Tversky, 1992a), maps (as well as pictorial and other
external representations) often show mixed perspectives; for example, many ancient and
modern maps of towns and cities show the network of roads from an overhead view and key
buildings from a frontal view (e.g., Tversky, 2000). Like Cubist and post-Cubist art, maps
can show different views simultaneously in ways that violate the rules of perspective, but
that may promote understanding of what is portrayed.
More commonly, maps show a single perspective, a two-dimensional overview of a
three-dimensional world. Designers of spaces, architects, seem to work and think in two
dimensions at a time, plans or elevations (Arnheim, 1977). Architectural plans map an over-
view of a design; they show the relations among entrances, walls, furniture, and the like,
and are used for designing behavior, for the functional aspects of buildings and complexes.
Elevations show how structures will be viewed from the outside, and they are important for
designing aesthetic aspects of buildings (Arnheim, 1977).
Producing and comprehending maps require other major mental transformations, integrat-
ing and shrinking a large environment, one that typically cannot be seen at a glance, to a
small one that can fit onto a piece of paper. Even preschoolers are able to perform some of
these mental feats, for example, using a schematic map to find a hidden toy (e.g., De
Loache, 2004). The creation of maps requires yet another mental feat, abstracting the
features that are important, that need to be included in the external representation, and

```

```

eliminating those that do not. The uses of maps range widely: road maps, weather maps,
maps of spread of populations of people, of plants, of diseases, maps for hiking, for surveil-
lance of water, of earthquakes, of soil quality, and more. The features that are essential to
include vary with the use; for some uses, mountains can be omitted but roads must be
included, and for others, mountains need to be preserved but roads can be eliminated.
Similarly, some kinds of maps add information not directly visible in the environment, such
as contour lines for topography of the ground or for weather fronts. Many of the same men-
tal processes used in creating and using external representations parallel those used in creat-
ing and using mental ones (e.g., Shephard & Podgorny, 1978), though there are naturally
differences as well. And, like mental representations, external representations constrain as
well as enable understandings and interpretations. The very same processes that facilitate
comprehension and communication, of inclusion and elimination, of leveling and sharpen-
ing, of addition and subtraction, also focus and constrain the meanings, with inevitable con-
sequences of misunderstandings, misinterpretations, and error.

2.3. Organizing space of a page, more metaphorically

Traditional pictures, architectural plans, and maps are literally spatial in the sense that
they represent things that are visible in the world, typically preserving shapes and spatial
relations among and within the forms. Such mappings are derived from the spatial world
through the mind, by schematizing or abstracting information from the spatial world. At
another extreme are mappings that are regarded as abstract or metaphorically spatial. Such
mappings are constructions, derived from mental representations in the mind through similar
schematizing processes to forms and places on the page. For concepts that are not literally
spatial, form and place are freed of any need to resemble ‘‘reality.’’ Nevertheless, the uses
of form and place in conveying meanings are constrained by certain psychological corre-
spondences, perceptual, cognitive, and social. Many of these metaphorically spatial con-
cepts are evident in spatial language: Someone is at the top of the class, another has fallen
into a depression, friends grow close or apart; a field is wide open, a topic is central to a
debate (e.g., Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). Those constraints and some of their consequences
will be discussed in the subsections below on organization of space as well as in the subse-
quent section on Forms in Space. We continue now with a discussion of certain properties
of the page, and how they are used to convey meanings.

2.3.1. Proximity: Category and continuum
Perhaps the most fundamental way that space is used to create abstract meaning is prox-
imity; things that are closer conceptually are placed closer on a page. As in organizing real
space, proximity can be used hierarchically to organize metaphoric spaces, first to create
clusters, groups, or categories of similar things (like the stack of shirts on a shelf), and then
to create clusters, groups, or categories of categories (like the men’s department). Grouping
by proximity is commonly used on the space of the page. The letters of one word are sepa-
rated from the letters of another word by a space, making reading easier. Ideas are further
separated on the page by paragraph indentation. Similar uses of space occur in writing and

508 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


comprehending math equations, where spacing affects the order of carrying out mathemati-
cal operations (Landy & Goldstone, 2007a,b).
Often the things to be represented are ordered, thus represented on a continuum: countries
by size, events by dates. When things are ordered conceptually, they can be arranged in an
order on a page, forming a continuum. If some pairs of the ordered things are conceptually
closer and others conceptually farther, proximity can be used to represent the closeness of
the pairs on the conceptual relationship. This spatial progression forms the conceptual basis
for simple mathematics as well as for graphing, conveying mathematical concepts on a page
(e.g., Dehaene, 1997; Fefferman, 2008).
How should orders be arrayed? The very shape of a page suggests three kinds of arrays:
horizontal, vertical, and central–peripheral. The salient dimensions of the world reinforce
the horizontal and vertical, and certain properties of vision reinforce center–periphery. Rep-
resenting orders entails selection of spatial dimension as well as selection of a direction
within a dimension, issues to be discussed in the following sections.

2.3.2. Central–peripheral
A center-outward organization reflects the organization of the retina, with the fovea, the
point of greatest acuity, at the center. Acuity, hence attention, is at the center of the visual
field, with acuity and attention declining in all directions from the center. That people orga-
nize space center-outwards seems inevitable. Just like the toddler placing her face smack in
the middle of someone’s field of view, putting something in the center of a page puts it liter-
ally and figuratively in the center of focus of the eye and of attention. Symbolic centers are
ubiquitous, from the angels around God to the etiquette of seating arrangements at a formal
dinner for a visiting dignitary (Arnheim, 1988). Early in the 20th century, an African king
wished to prove the modernity of his country by having it surveyed to make a map. On
learning that the capital of the country was not in the county’s geographic center, he ordered
that its location on the map be moved to be more central (Woodward & Lewis, 1998).
Mandalas, common in Hindu and Buddhist traditions, represent the cosmos or the spiritual
world, with spiritual symbols at the center. They not only symbolize the cosmos but also
serve as meditation aids, centering meditation on the center of the mandala (Fontana, 2005).
Greek and Roman vases place important figures in the center and less important to the sides
(Small, 1997), as do advertisements and paintings from all over the globe. Language does
this too, of course; we have been talking about the center and the periphery, both literally
and figuratively. These spatial features of vision become conceptual features of thought,
central or peripheral, a kind of embodiment.
A central–peripheral organization may coordinate well with a single focus of attention
and the organization of the eye, but it is not well suited for ordering, either of attention or of
things. The periphery extends in all directions from the center without an explicit direction
or ordering. At the extreme, a center–periphery organization is dichotomous: central and
important versus less central and important. Some mandalas have concentric rings that are
ordered outwards, but there is no clear ordering within each ring. Vases, advertisements,
and the like are organized by pictorial space as well as by center–periphery, so that the
periphery extends leftwards and rightwards (and⁄or downwards and upwards) from the

```
B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011) 509
```

center rather than in all directions as in a mandala. A horizontal (or vertical) organization
simplifies, but since the start point is the center, there is no explicit way to integrate the
orderings of things to either side. In addition, the human visual system is especially sensitive
to horizontal and vertical, less so to oblique lines (e.g., Howard, 1982). Perhaps for these
reasons, complete orderings tend to use a straight line, horizontal or vertical, one of the
edges of the page as a guide, and to begin at one end or the other. It is worth noting that
written languages, which typically require serial order, use vertical columns or horizontal
rows.

2.3.3. Page parallels
The central–peripheral⁄more important–less important arrangement of space has the
advantage of centering the most important, the highest on some attribute, but the disadvan-
tage of making it difficult to compare the orders of those in the periphery, as the order des-
cends in more than one direction. Using one of the dimensions of the page for ordering
makes the start point and direction explicit and easy to follow, but it raises the dual
questions of which dimension, vertical or horizontal, and where to start. Those decisions are
influenced by a number of factors. Some seem to be general across cultures, for example,
primacy to up, the location of gods in most cultures. Others seem to be more influenced by
culture, for example, horizontal direction, right to left or left to right.
To investigate the spontaneous use of spatial dimensions to convey abstract ones, chil-
dren from 4 years old to college age from three language cultures, English-speaking Ameri-
cans, Hebrew-speaking Israelis, and Arabic-speaking Israelis, were asked to place stickers
on a square page to indicate the relations of three instances on each of four dimensions: spa-
tial, temporal, quantitative, and preference (Tversky, Kugelmass, & Winter, 1991; for simi-
lar work on generating mathematics, see Hughes, 1986). Because English is written from
left to right but Hebrew and Arabic are written from right to left, the study also examined
the effects of writing order on inventions of graphs. For the spatial task, the experimenter
first positioned three small dolls in a row in front of the child and asked the child to place
stickers on the page to represent the locations of each of the dolls. All the children per-
formed the spatial mapping task with no difficulty. Then the children were asked to repre-
sent the more abstract concepts spatially. For representing time, the experimenter sat next
the child and asked the child to think about the times of the day for breakfast, for lunch, and
for dinner. For representing quantity, the experimenter asked the child to think about the
amount of candy in a handful, in a bagful, or on the shelf in the supermarket. For represent-
ing preference, the experimenter asked the child to think about a television show he or she
really liked, did not like at all, or sort of liked. Then the experimenter put a sticker in the
middle of the page for the middle value, lunch or the amount of candy in a bagful, or the
so-so TV show and asked the child to put a sticker on the page for the other two extreme
values, one at a time, in counter-balanced order.
A few of the youngest children did not put the stickers representing three examples on a
line; instead they scattered the stickers over the page or put one on top of the other, indicat-
ing that they did not see the instances as ordered on a continuum. Scattering the stickers
across the page suggests that the children saw the instances as three different categories and

510 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


piling them on top of each other suggests that the children saw the instances as a single cate-
gory, say meals or candy or TV shows. Either arrangement indicates that the children used
space categorically but not ordinally. Most of the preschool children and all of the older
children and adults did place the stickers (or dots, for the adults) on a virtual line, thereby
using one of the dimensions of the space of the page to represent the underlying dimension.
Children represented the more concrete dimension, time, as a line earlier than the more
abstract dimensions, quantity, and preference in that order.
A second experiment assessed whether children could map interval as well as order
(Tversky et al., 1991). They were first asked to place stickers to indicate the locations of the
three small dolls, when two were placed quite close to each other, but relatively far from the
third. Even the youngest children used spatial proximity to represent interval in the place-
ment of stickers. Then the children were asked to represent instances of temporal, quantita-
tive, and preference concepts that were unequally spaced. For example, they were asked to
place stickers to represent the time for breakfast, morning snack, and dinner. Despite heavy-
handed prompting, only at 11–12 years of age did children reliably place stickers closer for
instances closer on the dimension and place stickers farther for instances farther on the
dimension.
Together, the results indicated that children spontaneously use spatial proximity and linear
arrays to represent categorical, ordinal, and interval properties of abstract dimensions. With
increasing age, children’s representations progress from categorical to ordinal to interval.
Their graphic productions are true inventions; that is, they do not correspond to the graphing
conventions that older children are exposed to in school. For example, the directions of
increases in their graphic inventions, to which we turn now, were not consistent across
dimensions within or across children nor did they universally proceed from left to right.

2.3.4. Direction in space: Horizontal
Center–periphery uses direction, from the center outwards to the periphery to indicate
importance or closeness to God. Center–periphery mappings work well for vague cases,
where the center is the highlight and the exact ordering of the cases in the periphery is not
of concern. But if it is, a spatial order that is easy to discern is preferable. We have seen that
children and adults mapped orders of spatial, temporal, quantitative, and preference con-
cepts onto lines. For the case of time, the preferred orientation was horizontal across cul-
tures and ages. Mapping time to horizontal, evident even in Chinese, a language written in
columns (e.g., Boroditsky, 2001), is likely to have a basis in motion, which for humans and
most creatures and natural phenomenon, is primarily horizontal. Motion is in space, on the
plane, and takes time. In many senses, space, time, and motion are intertwined and some-
times interchangeable. Knowledge of space frequently comes from motion in time, from
exploring environments and piecing together the parts. Spatial distance is often expressed as
time, a 20-min walk or an hour’s drive. That said, concepts of space appear to be primary,
and concepts of time derived from concepts of space (Boroditsky, 2000), perhaps because
space can be viewed and time cannot. Time is a neutral dimension, and, as shall be seen,
the vertical dimension appears to be preferred for evaluative concepts and the horizontal
dimension for neutral concepts. Nevertheless, although time is primarily represented

```
B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011) 511
```

horizontally, as shall be seen, there are cases where time is represented vertically; for each
dimension, there is a preferred directionality.
In the studies of Tversky et al. (1991), children and adults from all three language cul-
tures preferred to map time horizontally. However, the direction of temporal increases
reflected cultural habits, specifically, the order of reading and writing. English speakers typi-
cally arrayed temporal events from left to right and Arabic speakers from right to left, corre-
sponding to the direction of writing in those languages. Hebrew speakers were split.
Although writing proceeds right to left in Hebrew, numbers proceed left to right, as in
Western languages. For the Arabic populations in this study, arithmetic is taught right to left
until 5th grade, when it is reversed to conform to Western conventions. In addition, Hebrew
characters are formed left to right, whereas Arabic characters are formed right to left, and
Hebrew-speaking Israelis are more likely to be exposed to Western left to right languages.
The influence of reading order appears for a wide range of concepts, especially those
related in some way to time. Counting, like writing, is serial, and takes place in time. The
mental number line has an implicit spatial ordering evident in speed of calculations, left-to-
right in readers of languages that go from left to right, and the opposite for languages that
go from right to left and absent in illiterates (e.g., Dehaene, 1997; Zebian, 2005). Temporal
order of events is gestured left to right in native Spanish speakers but right to left in native
Arabic speakers, even when speaking Spanish (e.g., Santiago, Lupia ́n ̃ez, Pe ́rez, & Funes,
2007). Writing order affects perception of motion (e.g., Maass, Pagani, & Berta, 2007;
Morikawa & McBeath, 1992), perceptual exploration and drawing (e.g., Chokron & De
Agostini, 2000; Nachshon, 1985; Vaid, Singh, Sakhuja, & Gupta, 2002), aesthetic judg-
ments (e.g., Chokron & De Agostini, 2000; Nachshon, Argaman, & Luria, 1999), emotion
judgments (Sakhuja, Gupta, Singh, and Vaid, 1996), judgments of agency, power, and speed
(Chatterjee, 2001, 2002; Hegarty, Lemieux, & McQueen, in press; Maass & Russo, 2003;
Suitner & Maass, 2007), and art (Chatterjee, 2001; McManus & Humphrey, 1973). A vari-
ety of factors correlated with reading order seem to underlie these effects. The effects of
reading order on perception of apparent motion and of speed and on perceptual organization
seem to derive from long-term reading habits. The effects of reading order on judgments of
agency, where figures on the left are seen as more powerful, seem to derive from language
syntax, where the actor is typically earlier in the sentence than the recipient of action.
The respondents in study by Tversky et al. (1991), children and adults, did not use a gra-
phic template to map abstract relations to the page. Mappings of quantity and preference, in
contrast to mappings of time, did not reflect reading order. Speakers of all three languages
were equally likely to map quantity and preference from right to left, left to right, and down
to up. That is, their horizontal mappings corresponded to writing order only half the time,
for both language orders. And vertical mappings were also used frequently, with large quan-
tities and preferred alternatives at the top. Mapping increases in quantity or preference from
up to down was avoided by all cultures especially for quantity and preference, for reasons
elaborated below.
Writing order is one mapping of order to the page, a weaker one that depends on culture.
In the large cross-cultural study of spontaneous mappings, it appeared only for temporal
concepts (Tversky et al., 1991). Even there, although English speakers tended to map order

512 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


left to right and Arabic speakers right to left in correspondence with writing and with
numerals, Hebrew speakers did not show a strong preference, most likely because they were
familiar with cultural artifacts ordered both ways. In contrast to the vertical dimension with
its strong asymmetry defined by gravity and corresponding to people’s upright posture, the
horizontal dimension has only weak asymmetries. Although the horizontal surface of the
world is very salient, it has no privileged direction, unlike the vertical direction defined by
gravity. The front–back axis of the body has strong asymmetries, but the left–right axis is
more or less symmetric. Handedness is a notable exception; however, it is primarily behav-
ioral rather than visible, and it varies across people with biases that depend on handedness
(e.g., Casasanto, 2009). The plasticity across cultures of left–right horizontal mappings sup-
ports the claim that for the page, directional bias along the horizontal axis is weaker
than directional bias along the vertical axis, hence influenced by cultural factors such as
writing⁄reading direction.
The plasticity of the horizontal left–right (or right–left) dimension, suggested by its influ-
ence from cultural factors, is no doubt partly due to the absence of salient left–right asym-
metries in the body or the world (e.g., Clark, 1973; Franklin & Tversky, 1990). It seems to
be reinforced by a salient fact about human communication, either with other humans or
with graphics. Communication normally happens face to face, where my left and right are
the reverse of yours or the reverse of that depicted. So although godly figures are depicted
or described with angels on his right and the devil on his left, his right is the viewers’ left.
Some languages do not even distinguish right from left, leading to different organizations of
space (e.g., Levinson, 2003). A number of factors, then, converge to render mappings to the
horizontal dimension to be more flexible than those to the vertical dimension.

2.3.5. Direction in space: Vertical
By contrast, the use of the vertical to express asymmetric evaluative concepts like power,
strength, and quality is evident in a broad range of gestures and linguistic expressions across
cultures and has a basis in the nature of the world and the things in it, including ourselves
(e.g., Clark, 1973; Cooper & Ross, 1975; Franklin & Tversky, 1990; Lakoff & Johnson,
1980; Talmy, 1983, 2000; Tversky, 2001). Gravity makes it more difficult to go up than to
go down, so that it takes power, strength, health, and energy to go upwards. People, along
with many other animals and plants, grow taller and stronger as they reach adulthood, and
taller people tend to be stronger. People who are healthy and happy have the energy to stand
tall and people who are weak or ill or depressed slump. Piles of money or other things grow
higher as their numbers increase. Remember that children and adults alike used the vertical
to represent increases in quantity and preference, with large quantities and preferences at
the top, never the reverse. In a more complex graphing task, children and adults preferred
steeper lines, those that incline more upwards, to represent greater rates (Gattis, 2002; Gattis
& Holyoak, 1996). On the whole, more power, better health, greater strength, and more
money are good, and less of all that is bad. This maps lower numbers to lower values and to
lower spatial positions and higher numbers to higher values and higher spatial positions.
The starting point is the ground. Low numbers are bad and high numbers are good. Gestures
such as high five and thumbs up reflect the correspondence of upwards with positive value.

```
B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011) 513
```

But mappings to vertical can conflict, with consequent confusions. The world and our
experiences in it provide reasons for beginning at the top. People’s major perceptual and
conceptual machinery, our eyes, our ears, and our brains, are at the top of our bodies. Read-
ing order enters here as well; most written languages begin at the top, whether they go left
to right or right to left, whether they are written in rows or columns. Numbering, then, can
begin at the top or begin at the bottom. So familiar are the two mappings to numbers that we
hardly notice the contradiction: the number one player, the one at the top, is the one with the
highest number of points. Rises in unemployment or inflation are bad, but are mapped
upwards because of rising numbers. These alternative mappings to vertical were seen in a
survey of common diagrams in college textbooks for biology, earth sciences, and linguistics
(Tversky, 2001). Almost all the diagrams of evolution had man (yes, man) at the top and
almost all of the geological eras had the present era at the top; that is, each kind of diagram
began at the bottom with prehistory, and depicted the culmination of ‘‘progress’’ at the top.
Earlier time was at the bottom, later time at the top. Although evolutionary trees have man
at the top, we speak of the ‘‘descent of man’’ not the ascent of man. In contrast, linguistic
trees, like family trees, typically had the progenitor language at the top and the language
derived from it descending downwards. For linguistic and family trees, time begins at the
top. In memory, the concept ‘‘depth of processing,’’ which suggests that lower is more
abstract and meaningful, is synonymous with the concept of ‘‘levels of processing,’’ which
specifies that higher levels of processing are deeper, more abstract, and meaningful. Deep
thought occurs at high levels of thinking.
Although there are multiple mappings of abstract dimensions and relations to direction in
space, there are also some consistencies. Notably, horizontal and vertical are chosen for
ordering, not diagonal or circular or some other path through space, undoubtedly related to
the privileged status of horizontal and vertical in vision (e.g., Howard, 1982). The horizontal
direction, the primary plane for motion, human and other, is readily mapped to time and
more frequently used for other neutral concepts. By contrast, the vertical dimension formed
by gravity is readily mapped to quantity and force, and more frequently used for evaluative
concepts like quantity and preference. The vertical direction has salient and far-reaching
asymmetries in the world and in human perception and behavior, with multiple correspon-
dences from evaluative concepts like strength, power, health, and wealth to the upwards
direction. The horizontal dimension has fewer asymmetries in the world and in human per-
ception and behavior so weaker, cultural variables affect direction, notably, the direction of
reading, writing, and arithmetic, and to some extent, handedness. These spatial meanings
are reflected in language and in gesture as well. While both those on the politically left and
those on the politically right will agree that it is better to be on top, they will disagree on
whether left or right is better.

2.4. Mapping meaning to space

A variety of examples have shown that people readily map meaning to space, and to the
space of a page. They use spatial properties of the page to relay a range of ideas, abstract,
and concrete: proximity, place, linear arrays, horizontal, vertical, and direction to group

514 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


categories, show relationships, illustrate orders, convey conceptual distance, express value,
and more. We have already accumulated a small catalog of meaningful mappings to space:
depictive or geographic, clumps for categories, center to catch attention or convey impor-
tance, lines for orders, distance⁄proximity in space to reflect distance⁄proximity on an
abstract dimension, horizontal for time and concepts related to time, vertical for strength,
quantity, force, power, and concepts related to them. Direction matters, too: Concordant
with the vertical asymmetry of the world created by gravity and the human experience of
living in the world, up is readily associated with increases in amount, strength, goodness,
and power. The horizontal dimension of the world is more neutral, so less strongly tied to
abstract concepts and more susceptible to cultural influences such as reading order and
handedness. But there are caveats on these mappings. For one thing, they are incomplete
and variable; different features may be mapped on different occasions. Hence, these map-
pings can conflict, especially when associated with number; a high score can determine who
is first. These correspondences arenaturalin the sense that they have been invented and
reinvented across cultures and contexts, they have origins in the body and the world, and
they are expressed in spatial arrangements, spatial language, and spatial gestures.

3. Forms in space

Now we turn from the space of the page to marks on the page, to examine how marks
convey a range of meanings, like space, by using natural correspondences. Although the
simplest marks are dots or lines, the most common now and throughout history are undoubt-
edly what have been referred to as pictograms, icons, depictions, or likenesses, from animals
on the ceilings of caves to deer on road signs. Marks on a page have been termedsigns,
which refer to objects for minds that interpret them, by Peirce, who distinguished three
kinds of them (e.g., Hartshorne & Weiss, 1960). Anicondenotes an object by resemblance,
anindex, such as a clock or thermometer, denotes an object by directly presenting a quality
of an object, and asymbol, a category that includes certificates as well as words, denotes an
object by convention.
Here, we first discuss some properties and uses of likenesses or icons, and then turn at
greater length to a specific kind of symbol, which we have called aglyph(e.g., Tversky,
2004; Tversky et al., 2002). Glyphs are simple figures like points, lines, blobs, and arrows,
which derive their meanings from their geometric or gestalt properties in context. Glyphs
are especially important in diagrams because they allow visual means of expressing com-
mon concepts that are not easily conveyed by likenesses. Glyphs have parallels to certain
kinds of gestures, for example, points that suggest things that can be conceived of as points
or linear gestures that suggest relationships between things. They also bear similarities to
words likepointandrelationshipwhose meanings vary with context.
Marks, whether likenesses or glyphs, like lines and circles, have visual characteristics
other than shape that increase their effectiveness in conveying meaning. An important fea-
ture is size. The greater the size, the greater the chance of attracting attention. The toddler
knows not only that centrality captures attention, but size as well. The toddler wanting

```
B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011) 515
```

attention puts her face close, blocking other things in the visual field. Size, like centrality,
can also indicate importance. Greek vases use both centrality and size; the major figure is
larger and in the center, with the others arrayed to either side in decreasing order of impor-
tance. Larger bar graphs represent greater quantity or higher ratings. Additional salient
visual features, like color, boldness of line, highlighting, and animation, also serve to attract
attention and convey importance.

3.1. Likenesses

Even sketchy likenesses can be readily recognized by the uninitiated. A toddler who had
never seen pictures but could label real objects recognized simple line drawings of common
objects (Hochberg & Brooks, 1962). Depictions have other impressive advantages over
words in addition to being readily recognized: They access meaning faster (Smith & Magee,
1980) and enjoy greater distinctiveness and memorability (e.g., Paivio, 1986). Perhaps
because of their advantages for establishing meaning and memory, likenesses are so com-
pelling that they are produced even when not needed and even when drawing them increases
time and effort: in diagrams of linear and cyclical processes produced by undergraduates
(Kessell & Tversky, 2009), in diagrams of information systems by graduate students in
design (Nickerson et al., 2008).
Likenesses have been creatively integrated into more abstract representations of quantita-
tive data by Neurath and his Vienna Circle and later colleagues in the form ofisotypes
(Neurath, 1936). Isotypes turn bars into depictions, for example, the number of airplanes in
an army or yearly production of corn by a country is represented by a proportional column
(or row) of schematic airplanes or corn plants.
Just as likenesses can facilitate comprehension and memory, they can also interfere.
Because depictions are specific and concrete, including them when they are not essential
to the meaning of a diagram can inhibit generalization, to sets of cases not depicted. By
contrast, glyphs, because they are abstractions, can encourage generalization. Capturing
the objects in the world and their spatial arrays in diagrams is compelling and has some
communicative value, but it can interfere or even conflict with the generalizations or
abstractions diagrams are meant to convey. An intriguing example comes from diagrams
of the water cycle in junior high science textbooks collected from around the world (Chou,
Vikaros, & Tversky, 2009, unpublished data). The typical water cycle diagram includes
mountains, snow, lakes, sky, and clouds. On the one hand, these diagrams intend to teach
the cycle of evaporation of surface water, formation of clouds, and precipitation. They use
arrows to indicate the directions of evaporation and precipitation. On the other hand, they
also want to show the water cycle on the geography of the world. As a consequence, the
arrows ascend and descend everywhere, so that the cyclicity is obscured. In studies investi-
gating interpretations of slope in diagrams of the atmosphere, students’ inferences were
more influenced by the conceptual mapping of rate to slope than by the geographic map-
ping (Gattis & Holyoak, 1996). In producing diagrams, for example, of a pond ecology,
when groups work in pairs, the compelling iconicity evident in individual productions
often disappears (Schwartz, 1995). Diagrams produced by dyads become more abstract,

516 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


most likely because the irrelevant or distracting iconicity is idiosyncratic and the abstrac-
tions shared.
The conflict between visualizing the world and visualizing the general phenomena that
occur in the world is especially evident when diagrams are used to convey the invisible such
as evaporation and gravity. With all the challenges of conveying the visible, conveying the
invisible, time, forces, values, and the like presents even more challenges. Glyphs are ideal
for visually conveying the invisible. They are not iconic, they do not depict the visible
world, so they do not confuse or distract, yet they share many of the advantages of visual
communication over purely symbolic communication, notably rapid access to meaning.
We turn now to many examples of using glyphs to visually convey invisible and abstract
concepts.

3.2. Meaningful glyphs

We shift now from the complex and representative to the simple and abstract. Probably
the simplest mark that can be made on the page is a dot, a mark of zero dimensions. Slightly
more complicated, a line, a single dimension, followed by various two-dimensional or
three-dimensional forms. These simple marks and others like them that we have termed
glyphshave context-dependent meanings suggested by their Gestalt or mathematical proper-
ties (Tversky, 2004, 2001). On a map of the United States, New York City can be repre-
sented as a point, or the route from New York to Chicago as a line, or the entire city can be
represented as a region, containing points and lines indicating, for example, roads, subway
stops, and subway lines. Continuing, New York City can also be diagrammed as a three-
dimensional space in which people move. Like many other spatial distinctions, this set of
distinctions has parallels in language and gesture, parallels that suggest the distinctions are
conceptual and widely applicable. Regarding an entity in zero, one, two, or three dimensions
has implications for thought. In a paper titled, ‘‘How language structures space,’’ Talmy
(2000) pointed out that we can conceptualize objects in space, events in time, mental states,
and more as zero-, one-, or two-dimensional entities. In English, prepositions are clues to
zero-, one-, two- (and three-) dimensional thinking, notablyat,on, andin. She waitedatthe
station, rodeonthe train, roseinthe elevator. She arrivedat2,ontime, and wasinthe meet-
ing until dinner. She wasatease,onbest behavior,ina receptive mood. Visual expressions
of dimensionality are common in diagrams, as they abstract and express key conceptual
components.

3.2.1. A visual toolkit for routes: Dots and lines
Dots, lines, and regions abound in diagrams. Dots and lines, nodes and links or edges are
the building blocks of route maps. They also form a toolkit for a related set of abstractions,
networks of all kinds. To uncover the basic visual and verbal vocabularies of route maps,
students outside a dormitory were asked if they knew how to get to a nearby fast food res-
taurant. If they did, they were asked either to draw a map or to write directions to get there.
A pair of studies confirmed that dots and lines, nodes and links, are the basic visual vocabu-
lary of route maps, and that each element in the visual vocabulary for route directions

corresponds to an element in the basic verbal vocabulary for route directions (Tversky &
Lee, 1998, 1999). Notably, although the sketch maps could have been analog, they were
not; turns were simplified to right angles and roads were either straight or curved. Land-
marks were represented as dot-like intersections identified by street names or as nonspecific
shapes. Short distances with many turns were lengthened to show the turns, and long dis-
tances with no actions were shortened. Thus, the route maps not only categorized continuous
aspects of the world, they also distorted them. Interestingly, the verbal directions were simi-
larly schematized. Distances were specified only by the bounding landmarks; turns were
specified only by the direction of the turn, not the degree. The consensus visual vocabulary
consisted of lines or curves, L, T, or + intersections, and dots or blobs as landmarks. The
corresponding verbal vocabulary consisted of terms like ‘‘go straight’’ or ‘‘follow around’’
for straight and curved paths, ‘‘take a,’’ ‘‘make a,’’ or ‘‘turn’’ for the intersections, and
named or implicit landmarks at turning points. The vocabulary of gestures used to describe
routes paralleled the visual and verbal vocabularies (Tversky et al., 2009). These close par-
allels between disparate modes of communication suggest that the same conceptual structure
for routes underlies all of them.
A second study provided students with either the visual or the verbal toolkit, and asked
them to use the toolkit to create instructions for several dozen destinations, near and far
(Lee & Tversky, 2005). They were asked to supplement the toolkits if needed. In spite of
that suggestion, very few students added elements; they succeeded in using the toolkits to
create a variety of new directions. Although the semantics (vocabularies) and syntax (rules
of combing semantic elements) of route maps and route directions were similar, their prag-
matics differs. Route maps cannot omit connections; they must be complete. Route direc-
tions can elide; for example, in a string of turns, one end-point is the next start-point, so it is
not necessary to mention both.
Why do directions that are so simplified and distorted work so well? Because they are
used in a context, and the context disambiguates (Tversky, 2003). This is another general
characteristic of diagrams; they are designed to be used by a specific set of users in a spe-
cific context. Indeed, part of the success of route maps and route directions is that they have
been developed in communities of users who collaborate, collectively and interactively pro-
ducing and comprehending, thereby fine-tuning the maps and directions, a natural kind of
user-testing that can be brought into the laboratory and accelerated (Tversky et al., 2007).
The success of the visual and verbal toolkits for creating route maps and route directions
has a number of implications. It has already provided cognitive design principles—paths
and turns are important; exact angles and distances are not—for creating a highly successful
algorithm for on-line on-demand route directions (Agrawala & Stolte, 2001). It suggests that
maps and verbal directions could be automatically translated from one to the other. It is
encouraging for finding similar visual and verbal intertranslatable vocabularies for other
domains, such as circuit diagrams or musical notation or even domains that are not as well
structured domains such as assembly instructions, chemistry, and design. It suggests empiri-
cal methods for uncovering domain-specific visual and verbal semantics, syntax, and prag-
matics. Finally, it shows that certain simple visual elements have meanings that are
spontaneously produced and interpreted in a context. Some of these visual elements have

greater generality. Lines are naturally produced and interpreted as paths connecting entities
or landmarks that are represented as dots. Hence their widespread use, from social networks,
connections among people, to computer networks, connections among computers or compo-
nents of computers, and more.

3.2.2. Lines connect, bars contain
As Klee put it, ‘‘A line is a dot that went for a walk.’’ Lines are also common in graphs,
again, as paths, connections, or relations. So are dots and bars. Graph lines connect dots rep-
resenting entities with particular values on dimensions represented by the lines. The line
indicates that the entities are related, that they share a common dimension, but have differ-
ent values on that dimension. Bars, in contrast to lines, are two-dimensional; they are con-
tainers that separate their contents from those of others. In graphs, bars indicate that all the
instances inside are the same and different from instances contained in other bars. To ascer-
tain whether people attribute those meanings to bars and lines, in a series of experiments,
students were shown a single graph, either a line graph or a bar graph, and asked to interpret
it (Zacks & Tversky, 1999). Some of the graphs had no content, just A’s and B’s. Other
graphs displayed either a discrete variable, height of men and women, or a continuous vari-
able, height of 10- and 12-year-olds. Because lines connect and bars contain and separate,
students were expected to favor trend descriptions for data presented as lines and favor dis-
crete comparisons for data presented as bars, especially for the graphs without content. For
the content-free graphs, the visual forms, bars or lines, had major effects on interpretations,
with far more trends for lines and discrete comparisons for bars. More surprisingly, the
visual forms had large effects on interpretations of graphs with content, in spite of contrary
content. For example, using a line to connect the height of women and men biased trend
interpretations, even, ‘‘as you get more male, you get taller.’’ These were comprehension
tasks. Mirror results were obtained in production tasks, where students were provided with a
description, trend, or discrete comparison, and asked to produce an appropriate graph. More
students produced line graphs when given trend descriptions and bar graphs when given dis-
crete comparisons, as before, in spite of contrary content. The meanings of the visual vocab-
ulary, lines or bars, then, had a stronger effect on interpretations and productions than the
conceptual character of the data. When the glyph, line or bar, matched the content, there
were more appropriate interpretations and when the glyph did not match the content, there
were more inappropriate interpretations (for other issues with bars and lines, see Shah &
Freedman, 2010).

3.2.3. Lines can mislead
Because glyphs such as lines, dots, boxes, and arrows, induce their own meanings, they
are likely to enhance diagrammatic communication when their natural meanings are consis-
tent with the intended meaning and to interfere with diagrammatic communication when the
natural meanings conflict with the intended meanings. This interaction was evident in the
case of bar and line graphs for discrete and continuous variables, where the interpretations
of the visual glyphs trumped the underlying structure of the data when they conflicted. Mis-
matches between the natural interpretations of lines as paths or connections and the intended

interpretations in diagrams turn out to underlie difficulties understanding and producing cer-
tain information systems designs. A central component of information system design is a
LAN or local area network, common in computer systems in every institution. All of the
components in a LAN are interconnected so that each can directly transmit and receive
information from each other. A natural way to represent that interconnectivity would be
lines between all pairs of components. For large systems, this would quickly lead to a clut-
tered, indecipherable diagram. To insure legibility, a LAN is diagramed as if a clothesline, a
horizontal line, with all the interconnected components hanging from it. However, when stu-
dents in information design are asked to generate all the shortest paths between components
from diagrams containing a LAN, many make errors. A common error demonstrates a
strong bias from the line glyph. The shortest paths many students generate show that they
think that to get from one component on a LAN to another, they must pass through all the
spatially intermediate components, much like traveling a route, to go from 10th St to 30th St
one must pass 11th, 12th, 13th, and so on (Corter, Rho, Zahner, Nickerson, & Tversky,
2009; Nickerson et al., 2008). Here, again, the visual trumps the conceptual and misleads.
Lines have mixed benefits in other cases, for example, in interpreting evolutionary dia-
grams where they can lead to false inferences (Novick & Catley, 2007). Yet another exam-
ple comes from visualizations of space, time, and agents, diagrams that are useful for
keeping track of schedules, suspects, pollen, disease, migrations, and more (Kessell &
Tversky, 2008). In one experiment, information about the locations of people over time was
presented either as tables with place and time as columns or rows and dots representing peo-
ple as entries or as tables with lines connecting individuals from place to place over time.
Because lines connect, one might expect that the lines would help to keep track of move-
ments of each individual. In one task, participants were asked to draw as many inferences as
they could from the diagrams; in another they were asked to verify whether a wide range of
inferences was true of the diagrams. At the end of the experiment, they were asked which
interface they preferred for particular inferences. Overall, participants performed better with
dots than with lines both in quantity of inferences drawn and in speed and accuracy of
verification. However, and consonant with expectations, there was one exception, one kind
of inference where dots lost their advantage, inferences about the sequence of locations of
individuals. For temporal sequence, lines were as effective and as preferred as dots.
Nevertheless, the lines interfered with generating and verifying other inferences. In another
experiment, participants were asked to generate diagrams that would represent the locations
of individuals over time. Most spontaneously produced table-like visualizations, notably
without lines. As for preferences, participants preferred the visualizations with dots over
those with lines except for temporal sequences. These findings suggest that popular visual-
izations that rely heavily on lines, such as parallel coordinates (e.g., Inselberg & Dimsdale,
1990) and especially parallel sets (e.g., Bendix, Kosara, & Hauser, 2006), should be used
with caution, and only when the lines are meaningful as connectors.
Arrowsare asymmetric lines. As a consequence, arrows suggest asymmetric relation-
ships. Arrows enjoy several natural correspondences that provide a basis for extracting
meaning. Arrows in the world fly in the direction of the arrowhead. The residue of water
erosion is a network of arrow-like lines pointing in the direction of erosion. The diagonals at

520 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


the head of an arrow converge to a point. Studies of both comprehension and production of
arrows show that arrows are naturally interpreted as asymmetric relationships. In a study of
comprehension, students were asked to interpret a diagram of one of three mechanical sys-
tems, a car brake, a pulley system, or a bicycle pump (Heiser & Tversky, 2006). Half of
each kind of the diagram included arrows, half did not. For the diagrams without arrows,
students gave structural descriptions, that is, they provided the spatial relations of the parts
of the systems. For the diagrams with arrows, students gave functional descriptions that pro-
vided the step-by-step causal operations of the systems. The second study provided a
description, either structural or functional, of one of the systems and asked students to pro-
duce a diagram. Students produced diagrams with labeled parts from the structural descrip-
tions but produced diagrams with arrows from the functional descriptions. Both
interpretation and production, then, showed that arrows suggest asymmetric temporal or
causal relations.
One of the benefits of arrows can also cause difficulties; they have many possible mean-
ings. Arrows suggest many possible asymmetric relations (Heiser & Tversky, 2006). Their
ambiguity can cause misconceptions and confusion. Arrows are used to label or focus atten-
tion; to convey sequence; to indicate temporal or causal relations; to show motion or forces;
and more. How many meanings? Some have proposed around seven (e.g., van der Waarde
& Westendorp, 2000, unpublished data), others, dozens (e.g., Horn, 1998). A survey of
diagrams in introductory science and engineering texts revealed that many diagrams had
different meanings of arrows in the same diagram, with no visual way to disambiguate them
(Tversky, Heiser, Lozano, MacKenzie, & Morrison, 2007).
Circles, with or without arrows, can be viewed as another variant on a line, one that
repeats with no beginning and no end. As such, circles have been used to visualize cycles,
processes that repeat with no beginning and no end. The common etymology of the two
words, circle and cycle, is one sign of the close relationship between the visual and the con-
ceptual. However, the analogies, like many analogies, are only partial. Circles are the same
at every point, with no natural divisions and no natural direction. Yet when we talk about
cycles, we talk about them as discrete sequences of steps, sometimes with a natural begin-
ning. Hence, cycles are often visualized as circles with boxes, text, or pictograms conveying
each stage of the process.
A series of studies on production and comprehension of visualizations of cyclical and lin-
ear processes asked participants to produce or interpret appropriate marks on paper (Kessell
& Tversky, 2009). In a set of studies, participants were asked to fill in circular diagrams
with four boxes at 12 o’clock, 3 o’clock, 6 o’clock, and 9 o’clock with the four steps of vari-
ous cyclical processes, everyday (e.g., washing clothes, seasons) and scientific (e.g., the
rock cycle, the water cycle). They did this easily. Although circles have no beginning, many
cycles there have a conceptual beginning, and students tended to place that at 12 o’clock,
and then proceed clockwise. Conversely, when asked to interpret labeled circular diagrams,
they began at 12 o’clock and proceeded clockwise, except when the ‘‘natural’’ starting point
of a cycle, for example, the one-cell stage of mitosis, was at another position. In a second
set of studies, students were given blank pages and asked to produce diagrams to portray
cyclical processes, like the seasons or the seed-to-plant-to-seed cycle, as well as linear

```

processes, like making scrambled eggs or the formation of fossil fuel. Both cycles and linear
processes had four stages. Unsurprisingly, most students portrayed the linear processes in
lines, but, more surprisingly, most portrayed the cyclical processes as lines as well, without
any return to the beginning. Heavy-handed procedures, presenting only cyclical processes,
calling them such, and listing the stages vertically, brought the frequency of circular dia-
grams to 40%. Changing the list of stages so that the first stage was also the last, as in ‘‘the
seed germinates, the flower grows, the flower is pollinated, a seed is formed, the seed germi-
nates,’’ induced slightly more than 50% of participants to draw the stages in a circle, but
still, more than 40% drew lines. There is strong resistance to producing circular diagrams
for cycles, even among college students. In the final study, participants were provided with
a linear or circular diagram of four stages of a cycle, and asked which they thought was bet-
ter. Over 80% of participants chose the circular display. This is the first case we have found
where production and preference do not match, though production lags comprehension in
other domains, notably, language acquisition.
Why do people prefer circular diagrams of cycles but produce linear ones? We speculate
that linear thinking is easier than circular; that is, it is easier to think of events as having a
beginning, a middle, and an end, a forward progression in time, than it is to think of events
as returning to where they started and beginning all over again, without end. Events occur in
time, time marches relentlessly forward, and does not bend back on itself. Each day is a new
day, each seed a new seed; it is not that a specific flower emanates from a seed and then
transforms back into one. Thinking in circles requires abstraction, it is not thinking about
the individual case, but rather thinking about the processes underlying all the cases. What is
more, the sense in which things return to where they started is different in different cases.
Every day has a morning, noon, and night, but each morning, noon, and night is unique. A
cell divides into two, and then each of those cells undergoes cell division. For clothing and
dishes, however, the very same articles of clothing and the very same dishes undergo wash-
ing, drying, putting away each time. Viewing a circular diagram enables that abstraction,
and once people ‘‘see’’ it (the diagram and the underlying ideas), they prefer the abstract
depiction of the general processes to the more concrete depiction of the individual case.

3.2.4. Boxes and frames
Earlier, we saw that people interpret bars as containers, separating their contents from
everything else. Boxes are an ancient noniconic depictive device, evident explicitly in
stained glass windows, but even prior to that, in Roman wall frescoes. Frames accentuate a
more elementary way of visually indicating conceptual relatedness, grouping by proximity,
for example, the spaces between words. Framing a picture is a way of saying that what is
inside the picture has a different status from what is outside the picture. Comics, of course,
use frames liberally, to divide events in time or views in space. Comics artists sometimes
violate that for effect, deliberately making their characters pop out of the frame or break the
fourth wall, sometimes talking directly to the reader. The visual trope of popping out of
the frame makes the dual levels clear, probably even to children: The story is in the frames,
the commentary outside (e.g., Wiesner, 2001; Tversky & Bresman, unpublished data).
Speech balloons and thought bubbles are a special kind of frame, reserved for speech or

522 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


thought; as for other frames, they serve to separate what is inside from what is outside.
Frames, like parentheses, can embed other frames, hierarchically, indicating levels of con-
ceptual spaces, allowing meta-levels and commentaries. Boxes and frames serving these
ends abound in diagrams, in flow charts, decision trees, networks, and more.

3.2.5. Complex combinations of glyphs
As was evident from the visual toolkit for routes, glyphs can be combined to create com-
plex diagrams that express complex thoughts and systems. Like combining words into sen-
tences, combining glyphs into systems follows domain-specific syntactic rules (e.g.,
Tversky & Lee, 1999). Networks of lines and nodes, more abstractly, concepts and connec-
tions between concepts, are so complete and frequent that they constitute a major type of
diagram. Others types of diagrams include the following: hierarchies, a kind of network with
a unique beginning and layers of asymmetric relations, such as taxonomies and organization
charts; flow charts consisting of nodes and links representing temporal organizations of pro-
cesses and outcomes; decision trees, also composed of nodes and links, where each node is
a choice. A slightly different type of diagram is a matrix, a set of boxes organized to repre-
sent the cross-categorization of sets of dimensions or attributes. These organized sets of
glyphs and space constituting diagrammatic types appear to match, to naturally map, con-
ceptual organizations of concepts and relations. That is, for networks, hierarchies, and matri-
ces, students were able to correctly match a variety of conceptual patterns onto the proper
visualization(Novick, Hurley, & Francis, 1999; Novick & Hurley, 2001).
Note that many of these visual complex combinations of glyphs, for example, bar and line
graphs, social and computer networks, decision and evolutionary trees, have no pictorial
information whatsoever, yet they inherit all the advantages of being visual. They enable
human application of visuospatial memory and reasoning skills to abstract domains.

3.2.6. Sketches
The aim of most of the diagrams discussed thus far is to convey certain information
clearly in ways that are easily apprehended, from route directions to data presentations to
scientific explanations. Another important role for visualizations of thought is to clarify and
develop thought. This kind of visualization is called a sketch because it is usually more ten-
tative and vague than a diagram. Sketches in early phases of design even of physical objects,
like products and buildings, are frequently just glyphs, lines and blobs, with no specific
shapes, sizes, or distances (e.g., Goel, 1995; Schon, 1983). Designers use their sketches in a
kind of conversation: They sketch, reexamine the sketch, and revise (Schon, 1983). They
are intentionally ambiguous. Ambiguity in sketches, just like ambiguity in poetry, encour-
ages a multitude of interpretations and reinterpretations. Experienced designers may get
new insights, see new relationships, make new inferences from reexamining their sketches,
a positive cycle that leads to new design ideas, followed by new sketches and new ideas
(Suwa & Tversky, 2001, 2003). Ambiguity can help designers innovate and escape fixation
by allowing perceptual reorganization and consequent new insights, a pair of processes, one
perceptual, finding new figures and relations, and one conceptual, finding new interpreta-
tions, termed ‘‘constructive perception’’ (Suwa & Tversky, 2001, 2003).

3.2.7. Glyphs: Simple geometric forms with related meanings
Diagrams and other forms of visual narratives are enhanced by the inclusion of a rich
assortment of schematic visual forms such as dots, lines, arrows, circles, and boxes, whose
meanings derive from and are constrained by their Gestalt or mathematical properties within
the confines of a context. The meanings they support, entities, relations, asymmetric rela-
tions, processes, and collections, are abstract, so apply to many domains. They encourage
the kind of abstractions needed for inference, analogy, generalization, transfer, and insight.
They have analogs in other means of recording and communicating ideas, in language and
in gesture, suggesting that they are elements of thought.
There are other abstract visual devices, infrequent in diagrams, but common in graphic
novels and comics, lines suggesting motion, sound, fear, sweat, emotions, and more (e.g.,
McCloud, 1994). Some of these, like the lines, boxes, and arrows discussed above, have
meanings suggested by their forms. Motion lines, for example, seem to have developed as a
short-hand or schematization of the perceptual blurring of viewed fast motion. Others, like
hearts for love, are more symbolic. The concepts conveyed by the diagrammatic schematic
forms are not as readily depictable as objects or even actions.
Those glyphs, such as dots, lines, arrows, frames, and circles, that enjoy a consensus of
context-dependent meanings evident in production and comprehension seem to derive their
meanings in ways similar to the ways pictograms establish meanings, overlapping features.
Among the properties of lines is that they connect, just as relationships, abstract or concrete,
connect. Among the properties of boxes is that they contain one set of things and separate
those from other things. What is in the box creates a category, leaving open the basis for cat-
egorization to the creator or interpreter. The box implies that the things in the box are more
related or similar to each other than to things out of the box. The box might contain a spatial
region, a temporal slice, a set of objects. These mappings of meaning, the transfer of a few
of the possible features from the object represented to the representing glyph, are partial and
variable. The consequence is variability of meaning, allowing ambiguity and misconception.
A case in point is uses of arrows, which map asymmetric relations. But there are a multitude
of asymmetric relations, temporal order, causal order, movement path, and more. In well-
designed diagrams, context can clarify, but there are all too many diagrams that are not well
designed.
The concepts suggested by glyphs have parallels in language and gesture with the same
tradeoffs between abstraction and ambiguity. Think of words, notably spatial ones that par-
allel glyphs, likerelationshiporregionorpoint. A romantic relationship? A mathematical
relationship? Here, context will likely disambiguate, but not on all occasions. There is good
reason why spatial concepts, whether diagrammatic or linguistic or gestural, have multiple
meanings; they allow expression of kinds of meanings that apply to many domains.
Much has been said on what depictions do well: make elements, relations, and transfor-
mations of thought visible, apply human skills in visuospatial reasoning to abstract domains,
encourage abstraction, enable inference, transfer, and insight, promote collaboration. But
many concepts essential to thought and innovation are not visible. A key significance of
glyphs is that they can visualize the invisible, entities, relations, forces, networks, trees, and
more.

4. Processing and designing diagrams

4.1. Processing diagrams

Good design must take into account the information-processing habits and limitations of
human users (e.g., Carpenter & Shah, 1998; Kosslyn, 1989, 2006; Pinker, 1990; Shah,
Freedman, & Vekiri, 2005; Tversky, Morrison, & Betrancourt, 2002). The page is flat, as is
the visual information captured by the retina. Reasoning from 3D diagrams is far more
difficult than reasoning from 2D diagrams whether depictive (e.g., Gobert, 1999) or
conceptual (e.g., Shah & Carpenter, 1995). Language, visual search, and reasoning are
sequential and limited, so that continuous animations of explanatory information can cause
difficulties (e.g., Ainsworth, 2008a,b; Hegarty, 1992; Hegarty, Kriz, & Cate, 2003; Schnotz
& Lowe, 2007; Tversky, 2001).
Ability matters. Spatial ability is not a unitary factor, and some aspects of spatial thinking,
especially performing mental transformations and integrating figures, matter for some situa-
tions and others for others (e.g., Hegarty, in press; Hegarty & Waller, 2006; Kozhevnikov,
Kosslyn, & Shephard, 2005; Suwa & Tversky, 2003). Different spatial, and undoubtedly
conceptual, abilities are needed for different kinds of tasks and inferences that involve dia-
grams.
Expertise matters. It can trade off with ability. As noted, diagrams, like language, are
incomplete and can be abstract, requiring filling in, bridging inferences. Domains include
implicit or explicit knowledge that allows bridging, encouraging correct interpretations and
discouraging incorrect ones. The significance of domain knowledge was illustrated in
route maps and holds a fortiori in more technical domains (e.g., Committee on Support for
Thinking Spatially, 2006).
Working memory matters. Although, as advertised, external representations relieve work-
ing memory, they do not eliminate it. Typically, diagrams are used for comprehension,
inference, and insight. All involve integrating or transforming the information in diagrams,
processes that take place in the mind, in working memory. Imagine multiplying two three-
digit numbers, even when the numbers are before your eyes, without being able to write
down the product of each step (see Shah & Miyake, 1996).
Structure matters. When diagrams are cluttered with information, finding and integrating
the relevant information takes working memory capacity. Schematization, that is, removing
irrelevant details, exaggerating, perhaps distorting, relevant ones, even adding relevant but
invisible information, can facilitate information processing in a variety of ways. Aerial pho-
tographs make poor driving maps. Schematization can reduce irrelevancies that can clutter,
thereby allowing attention to focus on important features, increasing both speed and accu-
racy of information processing (e.g., Dwyer, 1978; Smallman, St. John, Onck, & Cowen,
2001; Tversky, 2001).
Sequencing matters. Conveying sequential information, important in history, science,
engineering, and everyday life, poses special challenges. Sometimes a sequence of steps can
be shown in a single diagram; Minard’s famous diagram of Napoleon’s unsuccessful cam-
paign on Russia is a stellar example. Time lines of historical events are another common

```

successful example. Depicting each step separately and connecting them, often using frames
and arrows, is another popular solution, from Egyptian tomb paintings showing the making
of bread to Lego instructions. Both separating and connecting require careful design. People
segment continuous organized action sequences into meaningful units that connect percep-
tion and action, by changes in scene, actor, action, and object (e.g., Barker, 1963; Barker &
Wright, 1954; Tversky, Zacks, & Hard, 2008; Tversky et al., 2007; Zacks & Tversky, 2001;
Zacks, Tversky, & Iyer, 2001). A well-loved solution to showing processes that occur over
time is to use animations. Animations are attractive because they appear to conform to the
Congruity Principle: They use change in time to show change in time, a mentally congruent
relation (Tversky, 2001). However, as we have just seen, the mind often segments continu-
ous processes into steps (e.g., Tversky et al., 2007; Zacks et al., 2001), suggesting that
step-by-step presentation is more congruent to the way the mind understands and represents
continuous organized action than continuous presentation. The segmentation of routes by
turns and object assembly by actions provide illustrative examples. Animations can suffer
two other shortcomings: They are often too fast and too complex to take in, violating the
Apprehension Principle, and they show, but do not explain (Tversky et al., 2001). Even
more than in static diagrams, visualizing the invisible, causes, forces, and the like, is diffi-
cult in animations. And, indeed, a broad range of kinds of animations for a broad range of
content have not proved to be superior to static graphics (e.g., Mayer, Hegarty, Mayer, &
Campbell, 2005; Stasko & Lawrence, 1998; Tversky, 2001; Tversky, Heiser, et al., 2007).
Multi-media matters. Depictions and language differ in many ways, some discussed ear-
lier, among them, expressiveness, abstraction, constraints, accessibility to meaning (e.g.,
Stenning & Oberlander, 1995). As we have seen, many meanings may be easier to convey
through diagrams, but diagrams can also mislead. Diagrams usually contain words or other
symbolic information; the visuals, even augmented with glyphs, may not be sufficient. Maps
need names of countries, towns, or streets. Network diagrams need names of the nodes and
sometimes the edges. Economic graphs need labels and numeric scales to denote years or
countries or financial indices. Anatomical diagrams need names of muscles and bones. But
diagrams often need more than labels and scales. Although arrows can indicate causes and
forces, the specific forces and causes may need language. In addition, redundancy often
helps (e.g., Ainsworth, 2008a,b; Mayer, 2001). Just as diagrams need to be carefully
designed to be effective, so does language.

4.2. Designing diagrams

The previous analyses of place and form in diagrams were based on historical and con-
temporary examples that have been invented and reinvented across time and space. They
have been refined by the generations through informal user testing in the wild. The analyses
provide a general guideline for designing effective diagrams: Use place in space and forms
of marks to convey the kinds of meanings that they more naturally convey. For example,
use the vertical for evaluative dimensions, mapping increases upwards. Use the horizontal
for neutral dimensions, especially time, mapping increases in reading order. Use dots
for entities, lines for relations, arrows for asymmetric relations, boxes for collections.

526 B. Tversky⁄Topics in Cognitive Science 3 (2011)


Disambiguate when context is not sufficient. Although helpful, these are general guidelines
often not sufficient for specific cases.
The previous analyses of the evolution and refinement of diagrams also suggest methods
to systematically develop more specific guidelines when needed, to formalize the natural
user testing cycle—produce, use, refine—and bring it into the laboratory by turning users
into designers. One project used this procedure for developing cognitive design principles
for assembly instructions (Tversky et al., 2007). Students first assembled a TV cart using the
photograph on the box. They then designed instructions to help others assemble the cart.
Other groups of students used and rated the previous instructions. Analysis of the highly
rated and effective instructions revealed the following cognitive principles: Use one diagram
per step, segment one step per part, show action, show perspective of action, and use arrows
and guidelines to show attachment and action. A computer algorithm was created to con-
struct assembly diagrams using these guidelines, and the resulting visual instructions led to
better performance than those that came with the TV cart. These cognitive principles apply
not just to assembly diagrams but more broadly to visual explanations of how things behave
or work. Moreover, the cycle of producing, using, and refining diagrams is productive in
improving diagrams even with a single person (Karmiloff-Smith, 1979, 1990; Lee &
Karmiloff-Smith, 1996; Tversky & Suwa, 2009).

5. Diagrams as a microcosm of cognition

Diagrams and other depictions are expressions and communications of thought, a class
that includes gesture, action, and language. In common with gesture and action, diagrams
use place and form in space to convey meanings, concrete and abstract, quite directly. This
paper has presented an analysis and examples of the ways that place and form create mean-
ings, an analysis that included the horizontal, vertical, center–periphery, and pictorial orga-
nization of the page as well as the dots, lines, arrows, circles, boxes, and likenesses depicted
on a page. In combination, they enable creating the vast variety of visual expressions of
meaning, pictures, maps, mandalas, assembly instructions, highway signs, architectural
plans, science and engineering diagrams, charts, graphs, and more. Gestures also use many
of these features of meaning, but they are more schematic and fleeting; diagrams can be
regarded as the visible traces of gestures just as gesturing can be regarded as drawing pic-
tures in the air.
The foundations of diagrams lie in actions in space. People have always organized things
and spaces to serve their ends: securing, storing, and preparing food, making and using arti-
facts, designing shelter, navigating space. The consequences of these actions are the creation
of simple geometric patterns in space, patterns that are good gestalts, and that are readily
recognized. The patterns invite abstract interpretations: Groups signal similar features or
related themes, orders signal dimensions or continua, distributions signal one-to-one or one-
to-many correspondences. The creation and interpretation of these patterns form the rudi-
ments of abstract thought: categories, relationships, orderings, hierarchies, dimensions, and
counting (e.g., Dehaene, 1997; Gelman & Gallistel, 1986; Frank, Everett, Fedorenko, &

Gibson, 2008; Gordon, 2004; Hughes, 1986; Lakoff & Nunez, 2000). The spatial patterns
can be manipulated by the hands or by the mind (e.g., Shephard & Podgorny, 1978; Tver-
sky, 2005) to create further abstractions; they form spatial-action representations for the
abstractions that underlie the feats of the human mind, a three-way interaction that can be
termedspraction. Spractions, then, are actions in space, whether on objects or as gestures,
that create abstractions in the mind and patterns in the world, intertwined so that one primes
the others. Like language, spractions support and augment cognition and action; unlike
language, they do so silently and directly. The arrangements and organizations used to
design the world create diagrams in the world: The designed world is a diagram.
